# Rubik's Cube
A flask microservice that solves a rubik's cube by returning the rotations required to solve an input rubik's cube. Developed using Test-Driven-Development (TDD).

## Development Process

- **Analysis Phase**: Conducted analysis, including writing acceptance tests.
- **Pre-Architecture Phase**: Utilized CRC cards to describe classes, methods, and their interdependencies.
- **Planning Phase**: Estimated expected time and lines of code for the current iteration.
- **Construction Phase**: Followed Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, writing tests first and implementing code to pass them. Iteratively implemented planned architecture using CRC cards.
- **Review Phase**: Reviewed test code, ensuring comprehensive coverage of boundary values for each iteration. Used rubber duck debugging methodology.
- **Refactor Phase**: Refactored production code to remove code smells. If new boundary values were identified during the review phase, then go back to construction.
- **Post-Architecture Phase**: Revisited CRC cards, defining the actual implemented architecture for the current iteration. Compared Pre-Architecture and Post-Architecture CRC cards, identifying differences and questioning reasons for deviations.
- **Postmortem Phase**: Recorded actual lines of code and time for each phase in the current iteration. Analyzed differences between actual and expected time, questioning factors leading to over-estimation or under-estimation of total time recorded during planning phase.
